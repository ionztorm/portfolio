			<p>Hey, I&apos;m Leon, it&apos;s great to meet you...</p>
			<p>
				I&apos;m a self taught web developer hoping to secure employment as a
				junior developer. I&apos;ve spent my time so far studying HTML, CSS,
				JavaScript, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, React, and NextJS. I&apos;ve also
				studied some GoLang, and have plans to learn PHP and Laravel.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I&apos;m not studying, I enjoy watching Formula 1, and have a
				collection of model F1 cars and helmets (15 cars and 3 helmets, and
				counting). I like to keep myself active with either a 25km indoor cycle
				or 6km outdoor walk every day, weather permitting.
			</p>
			<p>
				While you&apos;re here, why not check out some of my projects below.
